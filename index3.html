				<li class="dd">1/2 carrot (120g / 4.2 ounces)</li>
				<li class="ee">4 sticks of BBQ Kimbap ham</li>
				<li class="ff">4 yellow radish pickle</li>
				<li class="gg">12 strips seasoned edible burdock root</li>
				<li class="hh">2 1/2 cups cooked short grain rice</li>
				<li class="ii">2 Tbsp sesame oil</li>
				<li class="jj">3/8 tsp fine sea salt</li>
				<p class="#">NB : *1 Tbsp = 15 ml, 1 Cup = 250 ml</p>

				<h3>How To Make Kimbab</h3>
				<li class="aaa">1. Rinse the spinach and parboil it in rapidly boiling water (30 seconds to 1 minute). Drain the water away and run some cold water over the spinach. Gently squeeze the spinach to remove any excess water. Put the spinach into a bowl. Add 1/8 tsp salt and 1/2 Tbsp sesame oil then mix them well.</li>
				<li class="bbb">2. Pre-heat a pan/skillet. Add a small dash of cooking oil and spread it around the pan. Add the beaten egg and cook both sides well over medium heat. Place the egg omelette on a cutting board and cut it into long strips.</li>
				<li class="ccc">3. In a heated pan, lightly cook the carrots, crab sticks and kimbap ham (about 1 min per ingredients), separately, and over medium heat. </li>
				<li class="ddd">4. Place the cooked rice into a mixing bowl then add 1/2 Tbsp sesame oil and 1/4 tsp fine sea salt (or more to taste). Mix them well with a rice spatula.</li>
				<li class="eee">5. Gather all the kimbap ingredients. This makes it easy to assemble.</li>
				<li class="fff">6. Place one dried seaweed sheet on the bamboo mat (shiny side down). Put the rice on the seaweed sheet then spread it evenly and thinly to cover about 2/3 of the seaweed. (Leave about 5cm / 2 inches gap at the top of the seaweed).</li>
				<li class="ggg">7. Now fill the seaweed with the filing ingredients. Make sure you evenly use the ingredients.Place one yellow radish pickle at about 1/3 point of the seaweed then add three burdock strips, one ham strip, one crab stick around it. Then pile up a few eggs strips, carrot sticks, and some spinach. Then roll the seaweed.If the seaweed doesn’t stick, paste some water on the gap you left in step 6. You can also use a few grains of cooked rice in this gap. Set the rolled kimbap aside.</li>
				<li class="hhh">8. Repeat the step 6 and 7 with the remaining ingredients.</li>
				<li class="iii">9. Line up all kimbap on a cutting board and paste some sesame oil (1 Tbsp) around the seaweed surface. Slice kimbap into bite size pieces.</li>
				<p class="jjj">NB : You normally serve kimbap with sliced yellow radish pickles. It doesn’t require a dipping sauce like sushi rolls do. However, if you want, you can serve it with some soy sauce.</p>
